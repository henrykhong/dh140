## About Me
👋 My name is Henry (he/him)! I'm a 3rd year majoring in Applied Ling. and double minoring in DH and Korean. Professionally, I want to work in 🗣 digital marketing 📈 because I want the liberty of alinging my 🎨 creative storytelling 🤝 and 🏗 tech. That said, DH 140 seems like the peferct opportunity for my interests, as I will be able to build on my computational abilties 🤓 and ulitmately use these hard-tech skills to fulfill humanities-driven research 🤔
