## Coure Objectives
* Demonstrate the value of data for humanistic inquiry through discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
* Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform humanistic research
* Learn to visualize data geo-temporally to communicate the importance of place-based and time-based informatics
* Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

## Personal Objectives
DH 140 seems like the peferct opportunity for my interests, as I will be able to build on my computational abilties 🤓 and ulitmately use these hard-tech skills to fulfill humanities-driven research 🤔

## Data Science Project
This past year has proven incredibly difficult and unrehearsed, as we continue this drawn-out battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March of 2020, the US has implemented numerous legislations and guidelines in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus. Not only were our personal lives impacted by these rapid changes (e.g., enforced masks, social distancing, limited gatherings) but we also saw dramatic changes in the workforce and school: massive layoffs, shuttered down campuses, and a mass human migration to Zoom. No one could've prepared for COVID-19, and in truth, many of us still aren't adjusted to this reality. With no answer to when this all will end, we can assume that people's confidence and outlook on life are extremely low.

For a project, I'm interested in examining human happiness in the context of COVID-19. My objective for this project would be to compare happiness scores between the US and Asia (e.g, China, South Korea, and Vietnam) since these two areas seem to be handling the pandemic differently. By comparing multiple factors (e.g., safety protocols, public compliance, death tolls), we can explain the quality of life in these different areas, and ultimately, make sense of why their happiness scores are represented the way they are.
