# "Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media"
This week's reading goes over the idea of "participation without condition" in which people are able to bear witness to events and engage in discourse without any barriers of access, specifically from higher instituions of powers. Especially in the face of digital humanities, there has been great pushes to create space (primariarly online) in which participants can engage with "broader publics in the design, creation, and dissemination of knowledge." Social technologies like Twitter and Youtube have been used by people to showcase narratives that have been silenced by the government. For example, the Iran chapter discusses how protestors used Twitter and YouTube to archive election protests in Tehran, as most footage of protests were censored by the government and deemed "anti-government" in the mainstream media. These platforms allowed protestors to give truth to their side of the story and raise attention to the unrest occuring in Iran on a global scale. And while much good can come out of social media, we must always view and consume media critically and cautiously. This is because anyone, such as politcal leaders, can access these platforms and use them for their own ends--whether that be democratic or authoritarian. A clear example of this is former President Trump indrectly egging his followers via Tweeter to commit insurrection and storm the capitol. As a result, my question is "While 'participation without condition' is a huge tenent of digital humanities, is it acceptable to set certain "guidelines" and restrict individuals from engaging in discourse if it means preventing hateful and dangerous rhetoric?"
