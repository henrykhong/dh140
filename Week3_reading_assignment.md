The video with Rachel Levine demonstrates the robustness of OpenStreetMap, which has led major companies such as Facebook and Uber to integrate OSM into their work models. Additionally, it's incredible to see humanitarian organizations, such as Red Cross, use OSM to create maps that can be used for community epidemics and pandemic preparedness. But platforms like OSM ultimately speak about the larger impacts and power of open data, as they lower the barriers of entry for humanitarian causes. Because data is now virtually public and free, people are supplied with a wealth of knowledge regarding different topics of interest (e.g. census, COVID-19, climate change) and can contextualize these data into visualizations and inferences.
