[Top 8 Data Science Use Cases in Marketing](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/11/top-8-data-science-use-cases-marketing.html)

The article singles out 8 different use cases in which marketers can carry out their technical objectives by incorporating data science into their work model. The cases support the idea that data can make real-life, tangible impacts in the world of marketing. For example, areas of marketing, such as customer segmentation, real-time/predictive analytics, and digital advertising, are made possible by data science and are popular marketing trends because they make delivering value to customers much more efficient and accurate. Data is in abundance, so it would be intuitive for marketers to draw meaningful insights from data to better plan marketing campaigns as well as inform corporate decision making.

I think many people often conflate marketing with social media, content creation, and storytelling. And while these creative functions make up a huge part of marketing objectives, this perception of marketing renders it one dimensional. But in fact, robust and effective marketing tactics come from also being data-driven! This article spoke to me because I plan on pursuing work in digital marketing and have personally experienced the efficacy of data science in marketing through my internships. SEO, statistical analysis, and automation systems are just a few ways that data science can save marketers time but still ensure accuracy and high performance in our campaigns. I have always been intimidated by data science, as I have always doubted my technical abilities; however, I understand that data is an inextricable part of modern marketing, and therefore, will always align my creativity with a technical and data-driven breadth.
